QUAD TREE

It is a two dimensional data structure in which a data node has 4 children and they are based on the following quadrants/directions:
1. North East
2. North West
3. South West
4. South East



We decide which child is which number child. For example: 
1st is NE
2nd is NW
3rd is SW
4th is SE


When we insert a new value, if root is NULL then it is created as root andx and y coordinates are gives as the data.
If root is not NULL, we compare the new values to be added with the root's x and y. Accordingly, we decide the region in which the new set should lie.
Now call insert function recursively and return the newly selected node as root..
Now that node is checked for quadrants and further decision is made.

It is often very efficient in comparing two-dimensional, ordered data points, usually operating in O(log n) time. 

Tree Optimization Approach

1. First of all, find the median of all the coordinates from x and all from y.
2. Now find the euclidian distance of all the points from the median point.
3. Sort the points in increasing order of their distances.
4. Now select the first point and make it root.
5. Take second re-arranged point and check the direction in which it is lying to root. Insert it there.
6. Now check the next point and so on.
